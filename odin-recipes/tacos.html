                <li>- 2 limes, juice</li>
                <li>- 1 tsp salt</li>

                <li>- 1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
                <li>- 1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
                <li>- 1/2 tsp black pepper </li>
                <li>- 1/4 tsp oregano</li>
                <li>- 1.33 lbs. lean sirloin steak, trimmed of all fat</li>
                <li>- 8 corn tortillas</li>
                <li>- 1/4 cup cilantro</li>
                <li>- 1/4 cup onions, chopped</li>
                <li>- 8 corn tortillas</li>
                <li>- 1/2 cup salsa</li>
            </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

            
                <p>1.  Preheat the oven to broil. You can also use a grill.</p>

                <p>2. Combine the lime juice and spices. Rub over the steak.</p>
                
                <p>3.  Broil (or grill) for 5-6 minutes per side for medium-rare, or to your desired doneness. Let rest for 10 minutes and slice thin or chop into small pieces. You can also chop the steak into smaller pieces and cook it in a skillet. It will take 3-5 minutes in a hot skillet with about one tablespoon of oil.</p>
                
                <p>4.  Prepare the taco fillings. While the steak is resting, prepare your desired taco fillings. You can choose from options like saut√©ed onions and peppers, sliced avocado, shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, grated cheese, and sour cream. Prepare these ingredients and arrange them in separate bowls for easy assembly.</p>
                <p>5.  Warm the tortillas and assemble the tacos. Heat a skillet over medium heat and warm the tortillas for about 30 seconds on each side until they become soft and pliable. As you warm the tortillas, transfer them to a plate and cover them with a clean kitchen towel to keep them warm. Once all the tortillas are warmed, assemble the tacos by placing a few slices or pieces of the cooked steak on each tortilla, followed by your desired fillings. Finish off with a sprinkle of fresh cilantro and any additional toppings you prefer.</p>
