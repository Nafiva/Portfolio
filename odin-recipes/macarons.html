          <ul>  
                <li>- 1 cup unsalted butter, 2 sticks, at room temperature </li>
                <li>- 3 cups powdered sugar</li>
                <li>- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>- 3 tablespoons heavy cream</li>

         </ul>  


<h3>Steps</h3>

            
                <p>1.  Make the macarons: In the bowl of a food processor, combine the powdered sugar, almond flour, and ½ teaspoon of salt, and process on low speed, until extra fine. Sift the almond flour mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. </p>

                <p>2. In a separate large bowl, beat the egg whites and the remaining ½ teaspoon of salt with an electric hand mixer until soft peaks form. Gradually add the granulated sugar until fully incorporated. Continue to beat until stiff peaks form.</p>
                
                <p>3. Add the vanilla and beat until incorporated. Add the food coloring and beat until just combined.</p>
                
                <p>4.  Add about ⅓ of the sifted almond flour mixture at a time to the beaten egg whites and use a spatula to gently fold until combined. After the last addition of almond flour, continue to fold slowly until the batter falls into ribbons and you can make a figure 8 while holding the spatula up..</p>

                <p>5.  Transfer the macaron batter into a piping bag fitted with a round tip.</p>

                <p>6.  Place 4 dots of the batter in each corner of a rimmed baking sheet, and place a piece of parchment paper over it,</p>
                
                <p>7.  Let the macarons sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour, until dry to the touch.</p>
                
                <p>8.  Preheat the oven to 300˚F (150˚C).</p>

                <p>9.  Bake the macarons for 17 minutes, until the feet are well-risen and the macarons don’t stick to the parchment paper.</p>

                <p>10.  Make the buttercream: In a large bowl, add the butter and beat with a mixer for 1 minute until light and fluffy. Sift in the powdered sugar and beat until fully incorporated. Add the vanilla and beat to combine.</p>
                
                <p>11.  Place in an airtight container for 24 hours to “bloom”.</p>
                
                <p>12.  Enjoy with love!</p>
